# brainvszombies
processing sketch showing cells with a brain (Neural net) fighting zombie cells or each other 
run in processing 3
cells with a brain fight zombie cells, or each other. They have a brain and can learn. The cells doing well can split and inherit the brain (the weights of the neural network) of the father. 
The cells can die too, giving way to birth of new cells. 
One can save the brain of a cell and eventually reintroduce it in an other game. 
For entertainment we can show the changing weights as the cells learn. 

Inspired by the "mitosis" example from Daniel Shiffman (youtube, coding train).
